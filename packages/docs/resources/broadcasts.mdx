Broadcasts are useful for manually triggering journeys. This is useful for sending one-off messages to a group of users. This is great for usecases like:

- Newsletters
- Product updates
- Promotions
- Announcements

## Steps

1. Create a segment which contains the users you'd like to broadcast to.

2. Create a template for the broadcast, optionally selecting a subscription group.
